# Core Concepts

> This page includes the core concepts of the new mod installer format. Since the format is still WIP, these can change and aren't finalized until they appear in the specification.

1) Reduce the amount of RTFM/layer 8 issues by providing the user with a guided installation process.
2) Use a dependency system.
3) Allow the format to be extended.

## Guided Installation

## Dependencies

## Extensibility

The base specification should be game-agnostic and cover the majority of use cases. Mod Managers that want to support this format must implement the base specification, but they are free to choose what extensions they want to support.

The manifest of the installer must be upfront about which extensions are required for the installer to work properly.
